- Security audits of various projects using, Solidity smart-contracts.

The following audit report structure is from [D-Squared](https://www.dylandavis.net/blog/2022/06/12/the-ideal-audit-report/), this is an extremely
helpful blog post from Dylan, and I recommend reading it.

    - Audit Report Structure

## Quality Writing:
- Writing should be simple enough that it does not defeat the reader.
- Professionally edited, free from major grammatical error.

## Executive Summary:
- The executive summary should tell the reader why this audit report is happening and how it will proceed.
- Include a thank you message.

## Limitations/Liabilities and Terms of Agreement:
- The reader should know that a security audit doesn’t automatically make a contract safe, the auditing firm is not liable for the unknown.
- Both parties have agreed to a set of pre-determined terms.

## Contract Overview:
- Looking at the 10,000 foot overview of a contract is an effective way to quickly improve the reader’s understanding.
- Explain the overall purpose of each contract.

## Various Tests:
- Emphasize the different types of tests done and the results of those tests.
- Include Echidna test scripts the developer can build on top of with an emphasis of incorporating those into their CI/CD pipelines.

## Level of Code/Project Maturity:
- A subjective, but important data point for investors to understand from an expert auditor on how mature this code base is relative to their peers.
- TODO

## Findings/Results of Tests in Categories:
- Labeling the severity of vulnerabilities in categories, e.g. “likelihood + impact = severity”.
- TODO diagram

## Exploit Scenarios:
- Explain the exploit scenario for each vulnerability.
- Provides a helpful reference during a recommendation.
- When developers know exactly how an exploit occurs they can implement best practices.
