## Executive Summary:
According to the Foam Chunk Smudge White Paper, this project will implement a complex project token economy. The diagram below will be used to calculate the severity of the vulnerabilities if any are found.</br>
For example:
- if the likelihood of that vulnerability being exploited because it is easy to attack, is high, with a severe impact if exploited, that would be a critical Cat 5 vulnerability

## 
| Likelihood(ease of attack) + | Impact = | Severity |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | 
| High(easy to attack) | Extreme | Cat 5 (Critical) | 
| Medium | Severe | Cat 4 (Dangerous) |
| Low(hard to attack) | Major | Cat 3 (Unsafe) |

Thank you for trusting us with your cyber-security needs.
```

## Limitations/Liabilities and Terms of Agreement:
- The reader should know that a security audit doesn‚Äôt automatically make a contract safe, the auditing firm is not liable for the unknown.
- Both parties have agreed to a set of pre-determined terms.

## Contract Overview:
- Looking at the 10,000 foot overview of a contract is an effective way to quickly improve the reader‚Äôs understanding.
- Explain the overall purpose of each contract.

## Level of Code/Project Maturity:
- A subjective, but important data point for investors to understand from an expert auditor on how mature this code base is relative to their peers.
- TODO

## Various Tests:
- Emphasize the different types of tests done and the results of those tests.
- Include Echidna test scripts the developer can build on top of with an emphasis of incorporating those into their CI/CD pipelines.

## Results of Tests/Vulnerabilities found labeled, inside Categories:
- Labeling the severity of vulnerabilities in categories, e.g. ‚Äúlikelihood + impact = severity‚Äù.
- TODO diagram

## Exploit Scenarios:
- Explain the exploit scenario for each vulnerability.
- Provides a helpful reference during a recommendation.
- When developers know exactly how an exploit occurs they can implement best practices.

## Recommendations:
- Straight to the point, with minimal jargon.
- A concise, but specific recommendation, with short-term and long-term recommendations.
